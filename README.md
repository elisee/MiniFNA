# What is MonoGame

MonoGame is an OpenSource, OpenGL implementation of Microsoft's XNA 4 APIs that allows developers to build games that run on Android, iPhone, iPad, MacOS, Linux and soon PlayStation Suite and Windows Metro, all reusing their existing XNA code that runs on Xbox 360 or Windows Phone 7.

The main repository is located at http://github.com/mono/monogame

# What is MonoGameMini

MonoGameMini is a stripped-down version of MonoGame, containing only the data structures (math & input mostly) and no platform-specific code.

It's meant to be used for libraries and console applications that require access to MonoGame / XNA data structures for processing.
